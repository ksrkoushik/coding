CHAPTER-I: NETWORK MODELS

1) MAC or PHY Address:
	Medium Access Control or Physical Address.
	It is a 48 bit, 12 digit number.
	first 6 digits: vendor or company ID or OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier or EUI-Extended Unique Identifier)
	Last 6 digits: device id or manufacturer's unique serial number
	
	Commands used:
	
	getmac, ipconfig /all (on windows) > Check for the "Physical Address" term.
	ifconfig, ip a (linux) > Check for the "link/ether" term.

2) IP Address:
		IPv4			IPv6
		32 bit			128 bit
		classful        	unlimited
		4 block			8 block
		8 bits x 4 blocks	16bits x 8 blocks

	Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 	S/N: 255.0.0.0,     Ranges from 1 - 127
	Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255	S/N: 255.255.0.0    Ranges from 128 - 191
	Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255  S/N: 255.255.255.0  Ranges from 192 - 223
	Class D,E are reserved for experimetal or scientific research.
	Note that 127.0.0.1 is reserved for loopback address.

3) DNS (Domain Name Server):
	IP <----> Name
	DNS Port No: 53
	Uses TCP/UDP Protocol
	nslookup <website-url> will give the corresponding IP Address
	Test the following in terminal (make sure that you have internet connection):
	nslookup
	>server 8.8.8.8
	>set type=ns
	>google.com

4) All about ALIASES:
	Aliases are like shorcuts for command names.
	The aliases can be created in two ways: temporary and permanent.
	for example: alias = lh = 'ls -l /root'
	for removing alias, type unalais lh

	creating/deleting permanent alias
	open .bashrc file or .zshrc file based on the type of shell you use and edit it by giving your aliases
	for example: 
	alias rm = 'rm -i'
	alias cp = 'cp -i'
	alais mv = 'mv -i'

5) Practice the following commands:
	which ll
	which echo
	which cat
	type ll
	type cat
	type host
	echo $PATH

	Understanding the difference between internal and external commands:
	INTERNAL COMMANDS: 
        These are part of the shell.
        These execute fast as they directly run from the shell.
        These provide only basic functionalities.
        Theses always run from RAM.

	EXTERNAL COMMANDS:
        These are not part of the shell.
        These are slow as they run from the disk.
        These provide all functionalities.
        These are complex.
        These commands run first time from the disk.
