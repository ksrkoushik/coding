	All about Docker
	
	> Containers are software units that are standardized.
	   They have the code and all the dependencies that makes it easier for the
	   application to run from one environment to the other.
	> Docker containers are isolated boxes which contain all ideal conditions
	  for the application to be executed on any operating system.
	> Docker keywords: BUILD, SHIP and RUN.
	
	> Docker Installation:
		>> On Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
		
	> Docker commands:
		docker --version
		docker images
		docker rmi <image-name or image-id>
		docker exec
		docker history
		docker info
		docker pull
		
	> Docker Container commands:
		docker ps
		docker create
		docker attach
		docker stop
		docker kill
		docker rename
		docker update
		
	> Docker File is like a bule print of environment.
		Docker File >>> Build >>> Docker Image >>> Run >>> Docker Container
	> Docker images are blueprints of the containers.
	> Docker image includes all the elements that are needed to run the app
	  as a container, these include config files, env variables, libraries and run time.
	  
	> The run command creates a container from the given image
