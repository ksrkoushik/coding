6) For LINKER ERRORS, Read the Error and check for the Unresolved issues and go to that object and see if it is properly linked to the project, else follow the below steps
   to link it properly by adding reference as shown in below steps:

		1) Inside Solution Explorer of Microsoft Visual Studio, Right click on Project and Click on Add -> Reference and then select the Project (Based on the LINK Error)
                   to be linked as a Reference to our project: ex: Add Support project as a reference to ATC Ground Station
		
		2) Then Right click on Properties of the Project and Go to Linker->Input and Add the paths in additional library directories 
		   and additional dependencies to the project(ATCGroundStation).
				Linker/General, Linker/Input	
	
		3) Build the individual project to which you want to refer, ex: SupportLib
		   and go the location where the .lib file is generated and copy that path.

		4) Then paste the copied path of .lib file and add in Linker/Input-->Additional Dependencies of the project
		5) Finally Clean the Solution and Rebuild the entire solution.....

		REPEAT THE STEPS 1 to 5 for all the LINKER Errors
