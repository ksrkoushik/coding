	> Structures and Unions
		
		Variables
		char x;       1 byte of memory
		int y;        4 bytes of memory
		
		Arrays
		char x[10];   10 bytes of memory with each of 1 byte
		int y[10];    10 bytes of memoery with each of 4 bytes
		
		Suppose, if we want to allocate as below , then the system allocates but at random locations, we dont want that
			char x;
			short y;
			long z;
		We want to allocate all consecutively at one block of memory,
		Structure is a user defined data type.
		It is a group of various data types.
		
		struct xyz abc;
		struct xyz abc
		{
			char x;
			short y;
			long z;
		}
		
		abc.x = 10;
		abc.y = 20;
		abc.z = 40;
		
		struct xyz *abc;//Structure Pointer
		abc = 4000;
		(*abc).x = 10;
		(*abc).y = 20;
		(*abc).z = 40;
		
		OR
		 abc->x = 10;
		 abc->y = 20;
		 abc->z = 40;
		
		Now, Lets take an example for better understanding:
		
			int main()
			{
				struct xyz
				{
					char x;
					short y;
					long z;
				};
				struct xyz abc;
				abc.x = 10;
				abc.y = 20;
				abc.z = 40;
				printf("%d%d%d\n", abc.x,abc.y,abc.z);
				printf("%d %d %d\n", &(abc.x), &(abc.y), &(abc.z));
			}
		There is a problem called Stuffing.
