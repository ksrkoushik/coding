Go to the directory task-python where fcud.py and mvs.py scripts are available:

	> pip install pyinstaller
	> pyinstaller --onefile fcud.py
	> pyinstaller --onefile mvs.py
	After PyInstaller finishes, you will find the dist directory in the same location. Inside the dist directory, 
	you will see the standalone executable files (fcud and mvs).
	
Containerize the generated fcud and mvs binaries:
	> Create a file named Dockerfile.fcud with the following content:
		# Use a base image suitable for running your binary (e.g., Alpine Linux)
		FROM alpine:latest

		# Copy your fcud binary into the container
		COPY dist/fcud /usr/local/bin/fcud

		# Set execute permission for the binary
		RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fcud

		# Define the command to run when the container starts
		CMD ["fcud"]
		
	> Create a file named Dockerfile.mvs with the following content:
		
		# Use a base image suitable for running your binary (e.g., Alpine Linux)
		FROM alpine:latest

		# Copy your mvs binary into the container
		COPY dist/mvs /usr/local/bin/mvs

		# Set execute permission for the binary
		RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mvs

		# Define the command to run when the container starts
		CMD ["mvs"]
		
	> Run the following commands to build Docker images for both fcud and mvs:
		docker build -f Dockerfile.fcud -t fcud .
		docker build -f Dockerfile.mvs -t mvs .
		
	> Once the Docker images are built, you can run Docker containers using these images:
		docker run --name fcud-container fcud
		docker run --name mvs-container mvs
