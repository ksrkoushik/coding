TFTP-BOOT Procedure:

	Required Setup:
	> Power the board using either connecting to PC using USB cable or using DC Adapter.
	> Connect Ethernet port of the BBB Hardware to PC's Ethernet port using Ethernet cable.
	> Also keep your SD card reday.
	
	> TFTP stands for Trivial File Transfer Protocol which can be used to transfer files between a TFTP server and a TFTP Client.
	
	Linux Host PC(Acts as TFTP Server with IP: 192.168.7.1) <----------------------------> BBB(TFTP Client with IP:192.168.7.2)

 		uImage                                                                         with these images (SPL, u-boot.img, 
 		                                                                               uEnv.txt upto U-boot)
		Initramfs
		We transfer these images using TFTP from
		Host to BBB over Ethernet
		
	> TFTP commands are useful in fetching all the required images stored on TFTP server (Host PC) and place them on the board.
	> To Automate all the TFTP commands, we use a uEnv.txt file with all the required commands for the TFTP boot process.

	> STEPS:
		1) We will keep the primary boot images like SPL, uboot and uEnv.txt on the SD card.
		2) We will keep other boot images like linux Kernel image, dtb and the initramfs on the linux host pc 
		   at the location: /var/lib/tftpboot.
		3) After that we first boot the board using SD card upto uboot.
		4) Then uboot reads the uEnv.txt file and executes the TFTP commands to fetch and place various boot images
		   from TFTP server on to the DDR memory.
		5) Then we will ask uboot to boot from the location where it placed the linux kernel image on the DDR memory.

Preparing TFTP host

	Setting up a TFTP server on Ubuntu host
	Step 1:  First on your Ubuntu host run the below command using your terminal program.

	This command installs the tftpd , xinetd(eXtended InterNET Daemon) . tftpd is a server for the Trivial File Transfer Protocol.

	$ sudo apt-get install xinetd tftp tftpd

	Step 2 : Create/Open the file “tftp” in the below directory

	$ sudo vi /etc/xinetd.d/tftp    and put the below entry in to this file  and save it

	service tftp
	{
	protocol = udp
	port = 69
	socket_type = dgram
	wait = yes
	user = nobody
	server = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
	server_args = /var/lib/tftpboot -s
	disable = no
	}	

	Step3 :

	Create a folder /var/lib/tftpboot and execute below commands

	$sudo mkdir /var/lib/tftpboot

	$sudo chmod -R 777 /var/lib/tftpboot

	$sudo chown -R nobody /var/lib/tftpboot

	Step 4: Restart the xinetd service. Now the xinetd daemon is running.

	$ sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart



To Configure the IP for Host:
	ifconfig eth0 192.168.27.1

On BBB
	setenv serverip 192.168.27.1
	setenv ipaddr 192.168.27.2
