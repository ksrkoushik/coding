// When you run this version of the program, you always get a message when you type Ctrl+C because  SIGINT is handled repeatedly by sigaction. To terminate the program,
//  you have to type Ctrl+\, which  generates the SIGQUIT signal by default
//
// The program calls sigaction instead of signal to set the signal handler for Ctrl+C
//(SIGINT) to the function ouch. It first has to set up a sigaction structure that contains
// the handler, a signal mask, and flags. In this case, you donâ€™t need any flags,
// and an empty signal mask is created with the new function, sigemptyset.
