1) TLS(Transport Layer Security) and SSL(Secure Socket Layer):
	> HTTP: Insecure Connection, Port:80
	> HTTPS: Encrypted Connection, Port:443
	> sslscan www.google.com

2) Disk Encryption:
	> Example: BitLocker for Windows10

3) Network Scanning:
	> Port scanning, Vulnerability Scanning, NMAP
	> nmap --version
	> nmap --help
	> nmap -sS <IP Address>
	> nmap -sT <IP Address>
	> nmap -sL <IP Adddress>
	> nmap -PR <IP Address>
	> nmap <IP Addr> -p21
	> nmap <IP Addr> -p443
	> nmap <IP Addr> -p21-100
	> nmap <IP Addr> -f
	> nmap <IP Addr> -sV

4) IDS (Intrusion Detection System):
	> NIDS, HIDS
	> IDS Evasion

5) What is Ethical Hacking?
   	What is Reconnaissance?
	> Understanding the target, collecting the infon etc.
	> Getting IP Address and Range
	> Getting DNS Records
	> Tools to be used:
		> A search engine: Google
		> URL of the target
		> nslookup
		> whois <domain-name>
		> Scanning Active Ports, Active Hosts, Services, Vulnerable Applns/OS
			> Scanning Tools: OpenVAS, Nikto, WireShark, Nessus
		> Exploitation:
			> Tools: BeEF, MetaSploit, SQLMap
		> Maintaining Access:
			> Having control over the target
			> Backdoors, Creating new users, Escalate Privileges, Rootkits, Trojans
			> Tools: PowerSploit, Weevly, dns2tcp
		> Covering Tracks:
			> Clearing Cache/Cookies
			> Tampering Log Files
			> Close Ports/Stop services
		> Reporting:
			> Create documentation of target vulnerabilities, weaknesses and loopholes.

6) What is SQL Injection?
		It is a technique used to execute malicious SQL statements.
